# Elm mini SPA (step 0)

## What?

This is the first step on creating a simple Elm web application using the
Single-page Application architecture.

At this step we are only creating a basic Elm document with a local counter.

The full steps are:

- **Step0:** Create a simple page applications ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step0))
- **Step1:** Upgrade to a full navigation application ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step1))
- **Step2:** Add an extra page ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step2))
- **Step3:** Support for global shared data ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step3))
- **Step4:** Make the illusion real ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step4))
- **Step5:** Making the web server happy ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step5))
- **Step6:** Adding a magical router ([code](https://github.com/csaltos/elm-mini-spa/blob/main/elm-mini-spa-step6))

> **IMPORTANT:** This is only one way to provide SPA support for Elm, you do not
> need to implement new projects following exactly this code, please use it only
> as a reference and at the step level you may require.

## How?

We will cover a sample step by step starting with a simple page with a counter
until we have a multiple page Elm web application with multiple local and global
counters.

For running this step code just execute the command:

```bash
cd elm-mini-spa-step0
elm-live -- src/Main.elm
```

And open your favorite browser pointing to <http://localhost:8080>
